# ClubIS

This is basically a fully functional club information management system.

It allows you to:
1. Sigin as a member of the club
2. Login and edit your profile
3. Search and view the profle of other club members
4. Run Events from the app where the attendees can checkin and checkout
5. Hold meetings and transcript the meetings in the in-built pad
6. Search and view meetings and event data
7. A fully-functional Notification system

Minor Features:
1. Change Profile Pictures
2. Change the wallpaper/background of the app
3. Upload wallpapers or delete existing ones

All the times and dates are automatically recorded in the database for events and meetings and the system also greets the attendees.

This is a labor of love and sadly no framework was used.
Create a Database named ict_club in the xampp mysql dbms.

We use it in our college's IT Club.
